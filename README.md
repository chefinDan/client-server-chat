# client-server-chat
A client-server network application that uses TCP connections to send short messages with user handles.
This program is best demoed using two adjacent terminal windows. One for the server and one for the client.

Usage: To run this program, do:

```bash

  ./startChatClient
```
Both the client and server can be run on localhost, or the server may be run on
the flip.engr.oregonstate servers, and the client run from localhost.
